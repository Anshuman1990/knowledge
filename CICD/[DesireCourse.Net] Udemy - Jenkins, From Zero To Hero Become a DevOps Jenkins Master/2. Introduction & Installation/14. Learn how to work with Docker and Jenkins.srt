1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,140
Ok cool.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:06,380
So now that we have configured everything in that we're using a better interface.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:12,940
We are going to start learning how to use Jenkin's remember that if you do an L as you're going to see

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,970
these folder which is jinking Zeta we created that for before.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:23,360
So just go ahead and change directory to that folder and if you need LS you're going to see the doctor

6
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,790
compose for you are going to use these docs recomposed file a lot because remember that this file contains

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,150
the definitions for the service itself.

8
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,980
So if we go to the browser now and we reload we have the service up and running.

9
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:45,180
But what happens if we want to stop the service or if we want to reboot or machine then to stop the

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,800
service we need to do at Duckery compose stop.

11
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,880
And this is going to stop the service itself.

12
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,700
So if we reload here the service is no longer alive.

13
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,680
If we do a duck croupiers you see that there is no container running.

14
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:03,180
Therefore you have a network here.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:10,650
So if you want to start your service you do at daquiri compose start and then you do a ducker appears

16
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,970
and you see that the container is actually up and running.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,820
So if I were reloading here it takes some seconds for Jenkins to completely Buddh up.

18
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,380
So that's how you work with this.

19
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,950
Maybe if you want to use service you are going to deduct or compose maybe a restart Jenkin's which is

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,420
the name of the service that you want to restart.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,010
This is going to stop it and then it's going to start to go back and what happens if you want to completely

22
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:40,120
delete your entire service.

23
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,590
So.

24
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:41,480
OK.

25
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:48,430
You are going to do a daquiri composed down and this down is going to delete everything related to disserve

26
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,700
is that it's not going to delete.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,820
Well we say from the volumes do you remember divulgence if we take color darker compose file we see

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,430
that indecorum pad we have a volume which is this one.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,630
And if we do analysis here we're going to see all of the files that belong to Jenkyns.

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:14,220
So if we recreate that this service this is going to look for the files in this folder and then is going

31
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,330
to map those files into that container itself.

32
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:24,130
So let's do this joker composed Abdul-Hadi creates the service or recreates the services.

33
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:31,290
So if we do that Dr. Pierce does services up and running so let's keep the browser and see what happens.

34
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:37,590
So as you can see Jenkins is just getting ready to work and we should have all the configuration that

35
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,450
we have already done like installing plugins or configuring the admin password and all of that stuff.

36
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:51,830
So these videos for those guys who don't know how to use Dharker or for people who have never used doctor

37
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,770
before and don't know how to use Dr. compote.

38
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,700
So that's pretty simple.

39
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,160
Does the doctor compose up to create a service or is recreated a stop for a stop in it start for it

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,320
start to narrow and down for delay in it.

41
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,570
So this is pretty cool.

42
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:11,600
Our Jenkin's services are really ready to accept connections.

43
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:15,760
So we kind of start playing around with this so see in the next lesson.
