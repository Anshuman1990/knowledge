00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,510
Hello and welcome to these Jenkin's course we are and have yet to get or learn in Jenkin's through all

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,370
the entire tar course.

3
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,460
So OK the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to look for the Jenkin's page here.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,680
Can I do Jenkins and then we have the page here which is Jenkin's that you and we are going to click

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,230
on.

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:23,680
You can see this is the page of the of Jenkin's itself.

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,220
So if we're going to be learning Jenkin's through the course I think that it's important to know why

8
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,790
it is.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,720
Jenkins of course we need to know.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,910
So as you can see here Jenkins is the leading Open-Source automation server.

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,750
So what is Jenkyns.

12
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:49,070
Well first simplicity we can say the Jenkin's is purely an odd mation server as you are reading here

13
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:51,290
and what is an automation server.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:55,400
Of course it works to automate everything that you want.

15
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:00,660
Anything you want You can't out of my dad with Jenkins of course these days.

16
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:06,330
Jenkins is being used a lot for a continuous integration and for continuous delivery.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,120
Don't worry about that yet.

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,850
We're going to have an entire section for learning continuous integration and continuous delivery.

19
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:18,900
But for now keep in mind that you can use Jenkin's to automate anything that you want.

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,430
OK.

21
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:27,620
So through the course of learning how to integrate Jenkin's with Dr. Inzi ball Amazon Web Services get

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:35,390
Mavin a how to create pipelines continuous integration continuos delivery the zeal in more.

23
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,710
So these are all in more is waiting for us through the entire inquiries.

24
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,840
Don't worry you have never used these tools before.

25
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:47,530
Like if Loker or Amazon or ansible.

26
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:53,540
Don't worry because we're going to be covering that and we're going to be explaining how to use them

27
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,730
and how to integrate them with Jenkyns.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,430
So this and more I'll see you in the next lesson.
