00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,900
Hello and welcome back into previews.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,510
So doctor and now we're going to install a utility which is called Dharker compose.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,410
So if you type croupiers you should have no reverse at this point.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,460
And now we're going to start Dr. compose.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,620
So where did you go to our friend Google.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,850
And we're going to look for Dr. compose installation.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,300
Nice.

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,250
We'll look forward to first resolved.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,760
Click on that and then there is a part here where he has land and so we click on linens and we're just

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,550
going to copy and paste this command over and copy and we're going to paste it in here.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:47,070
We give the word password 134.

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:56,060
After you've done this you can do a pseudo change mode flossed X which means we're going to give executable

13
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,610
permissions to user local does it compose.

14
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,030
As you can see here.

15
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,870
This is where we are downloading the vinery to these locations so we give it executable permissions.

16
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:17,210
So after we do it we can test it by doing a Duckery compose and then we hit enter and we should have

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,510
this out.

18
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:19,670
And that's it.

19
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,010
You have installed doc or compose.
