1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,770
Ok cool.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,090
So now we have our mission ready and we're going to log in.

3
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:12,480
So we're going to use the user Jenkin's that we created and we're going to give the powers were 1 2

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
3 4 that we created.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,450
Ok cool.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:17,370
So here we are now.

7
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,340
What we want to know is the IP of this machine.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,760
So we type IP a hit enter and then you're going to see the IP address right here.

9
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,800
This is my IP address.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:39,300
So you are going to probably have an IP address like 1 9 2 1 6 8 something that something.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,750
But don't worry you just use that IP.

12
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:48,120
So now that we have these IP addresses we want to connect to these IP using the sage but how do we do

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,890
it easy.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,290
We go to Google and then we're going to look for puti here.

15
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,320
Beauty is a client for S-sh on Windows.

16
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:07,100
So we just go here we click here and then we should be using 64 bit as I told you before.

17
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,710
So we're going to download this.

18
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,470
And that's pretty simple.

19
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,950
We wait until the download finishes and then we're just going to go here.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,670
Are you going to click on this.

21
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,020
We're going to click next.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,550
I already have these installs so you should click on next but I'm going to click on repeller and next

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:30,840
next next and this is going to do all the work.

24
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:36,750
So cool once puti is installed you can see that I already create a shirt here but you can look for it

25
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,030
on your applications.

26
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,140
Or you type pretty.

27
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,420
And there you go.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:47,560
So now what we're going to do is we're going to graph the IP address and we're going to create a connection.

29
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,340
So OK the first thing that we're going to do is that you are going to probably want to have the appearance

30
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,320
to increase the font size.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:59,670
So you go here into window perience and click on change.

32
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,410
Now you can choose the size that you want the fun that you want.

33
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:09,800
I'm going to choose a 12 size I'm going to click OK then I'll be back to the session.

34
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,190
And I will type the IP address that is in here the left.

35
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:23,540
So that is 10 dot 130 thirty nine DOD 2 5 4.

36
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,240
Cool.

37
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,980
So now I will give in the safe session.

38
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,450
I will give you the name like Jenkin's machine or whatever you want.

39
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,750
And then I will click on safe.

40
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,370
Cool.

41
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,660
So now I can just closed and I can open it again.

42
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,640
And as you can see here here is my connection.

43
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,760
Then if I just want a loaded I just click on this and I click on the button.

44
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:57,470
And as you can see here it appears the IP and appearance it appears are where it conflagration.

45
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:03,640
So once we are here we click open and then we're going to log in as these are Jenkyns.

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,540
Using 1 2 3 4 cool.

47
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,010
So we are really logged in into this machine.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,580
So what do we do here.

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,630
That's pretty simple.

50
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:23,940
We connected to there's a machine in here from Pootie using as a sage and why you may be asking.

51
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,860
And that's pretty simple.

52
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:34,190
It's because managing things from Pudi is actually pretty simple and it's even easier done doing it

53
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,430
from the virtual box window.

54
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:41,060
So we're going to keep this machine powered on.

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:46,440
So we're going to minimizers And OK we are as you can see in the same machine but now we're connected

56
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,370
through the which is pretty cool.

57
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,640
So now if you type IP A You are going to see the exact same IP address that you saw before.

58
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,240
So OK you already know how to connect to your machine using Pootie.

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,720
So let's do it again.

60
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,160
If you want to close or you just close it open up booty after you are here.

61
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,910
What you are going to do is that you're going to click on your Jenkin's machine state where you can

62
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,680
actually download then click Open logon as the user Jenkyns give it a password.

63
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,220
Please remember that you need it.

64
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:27,270
Your machine needs to be powered on before doing this because if it's not powered on then you're going

65
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,710
to have some errors.
