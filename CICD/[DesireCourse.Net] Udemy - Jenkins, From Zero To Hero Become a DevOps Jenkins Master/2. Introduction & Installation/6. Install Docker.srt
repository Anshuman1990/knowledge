00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:08,220
Hello and welcome back in the previews VDU we created that connection through Pudi using S-sh to connect

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,280
to our virtual machine.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,740
We are very connected here as you can see.

4
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:18,570
And now what we're going to do is we're going to use Duckery if you have never used it before.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:21,890
Don't worry we're going to learn a little bit of daquiri here.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,820
And you must know that doctor is only available for certain platforms on Linux.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,580
So in this case I'm going to look for a Santo's doctor for Central because we're going to start looking

8
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,490
for the documentation.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,460
Something pretty important please before doing it.

10
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,550
Make sure that you can reach Internet from your machine.

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,660
So if you type ping Google dot com you should have announced are like this.

12
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,680
OK.

13
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,550
So where are you going to look for dear's resort which is the first one.

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:04,020
And as you can see here on the left side these are the steps to install darker on the Santo's or DVN

15
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:10,010
or Fedora or Jew or whatever you have use to create a virtual machine.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:17,070
And we're going to install this as you can see here we're just going to copy this command and we're

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,570
going to pay sitting here.

18
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,220
Oh how you pays in Pudi.

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,340
That's a good question.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,470
You pays using the right click button on your mouse.

21
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,960
So you click your right button on your mouse and then you can paste it.

22
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,950
Cool.

23
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,280
So what we're going to do here is that we're going to pasted.

24
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,300
We hit enter and then we give the password of 1 2 3 4.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,050
After doing this as you can see there is going to be as crane that is going to show you all that installation

26
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,250
for these packages.

27
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,570
So let's wait until this finishes.

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,710
Great.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,750
The insulation already finished.

30
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,680
So where you going to be following the guide.

31
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,670
Where are you going to copy and paste these command which is going to as you can see here it's going

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,270
to out that repository for St. Louis.

33
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:15,230
Please remember that these steps are for St. Joe's Only if you are using in-order distribution.

34
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:19,660
Please read the Debian Fedora Ubuntu documentation.

35
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:25,680
OK so the next thing that we're going to do is that we're going to install the repository as simple

36
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,590
as this.

37
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,680
Jim in Soldat Kurt dasht CD.

38
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,320
That's it.

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,710
So this is going to ask for approval.

40
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,570
Where you gonna say yes here.

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:36,560
Click here.

42
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,250
Enter.

43
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,600
And then we just need to wait until this installation finishes.

44
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,850
It's going to ask for approval again to you.

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,790
Yes.

46
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,830
And then we wait until this finishes.

47
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,270
It may take some minutes.

48
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,220
Don't worry if the screen gets stuck for some seconds it's normal.

49
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:57,890
OK.

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,680
As you can see here Dean Salesian already finished and we are ready to go.

51
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,970
So after this we're done with this guy we can just start the service.

52
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,990
As you can see here we're just going to copy this command and we're going to start to dock her servies.

53
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:17,780
Now we're going to naval the darkhorse service at boot.

54
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,010
It means that whenever our machine reboots the car service is going to start with our system.

55
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:31,400
So for doing days we type pseudo system CTO in naval docker.

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,490
OK.

57
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:33,310
Nice.

58
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:40,390
And now if you want to test your installation you do a duck or Piers and you have a natural heater.

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:42,220
So how do you fix these errors.

60
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,790
This is pretty simple.

61
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:52,940
We're going to do a Suda user mode dodge a G and then we say Dr. Jenkins we don't enter.

62
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,010
And what do we do here.

63
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:01,540
User Mode is Lillenas command that allows us to modify an existing user as you can see here.

64
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:03,960
We're using the user Jenkyns.

65
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:13,780
So we are telling here to Linux this whereas say inhaling X plays at the user Jenkin's to dig group

66
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,080
daquiri.

67
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,560
So that's what we have done.

68
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:24,070
And if we tap Dr. Pierce we still have that error and that's because we need to look out and then look

69
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,690
back in.

70
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:31,250
So we're going to look out of here and we're going to open up our decision again.

71
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:38,170
We click on load we can open then we have the user Jenkin's that allowed to report and we try again

72
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,570
type in darker and nice.

73
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,310
This is where it can like a term.
