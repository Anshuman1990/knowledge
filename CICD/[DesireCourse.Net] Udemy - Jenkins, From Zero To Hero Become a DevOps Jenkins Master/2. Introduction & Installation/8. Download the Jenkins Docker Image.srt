Hello and welcome back in this Liz.

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:08,790
We're going to learn how to install Jenkyns and we're going to install Jenkin's using Duckery.

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,260
That's why we installed daquiri before.

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,010
OK.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:15,510
So as you may know or if you don't know don't worry.

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:20,120
But Duckery uses something called an image and image is like.

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:23,470
And is nap sheared off a conflagration.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,780
So in this case we're going to look for a Jenkin's image which has already all the configuration.

9
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:36,840
And we just need to run that image and then we will have our Jenkin's server up and running in some

10
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,800
minutes.

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:45,210
So let's head to Google dot com and let's look for Dr. Jenkins image.

12
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:54,390
We hit enter and then we're going to go to our first resort and as you can see here we have these Jenkin's

13
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,500
which is the official in March for a doctor.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,420
So we're going to copy this command and this command is going to download the image.

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:12,430
So we go here and what we're going to do is we're going to pay this command and we hit enter OK.

16
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,990
As you can see the image is already downloading.

17
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,130
We only need to wait until the process completes and we are almost done.

18
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:29,530
This is the magic of Doctor doctor allows you to create services quite easy with images.

19
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:37,200
So you only need to have one image and then you're going to be able to pick up one service pretty fast

20
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:38,990
and that's cool.

21
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:44,760
You just need to create an image or look for an existing name and run that image and then you have your

22
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,470
servers up and running.

23
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,620
Don't worry if you don't know Dharker we are going to learn here.

24
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:57,170
So OK you already downloaded this image but where is this much located.

25
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:03,660
Well if you type darker images then you are going to see your image here which is pretty good.

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,340
It's a little bit heavy but don't worry.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:14,070
OK so we have if you must know if you type jocker info and you grab for rude you are going to know we're

28
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:16,530
Dharker is saving the files.

29
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,140
So this is the location.

30
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:27,260
If you do something like sudo do dash is age and then you give the path you're going to know how much

31
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:36,420
this pays is that Kurt taken in this case they taking this size because we downloaded this image.

32
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,710
Ok cool.

33
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:40,830
So we already downloaded the Jenkin's image.

34
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,850
Now it's time to run it.

35
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,740
So for that.

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,480
See you in the next lesson.
