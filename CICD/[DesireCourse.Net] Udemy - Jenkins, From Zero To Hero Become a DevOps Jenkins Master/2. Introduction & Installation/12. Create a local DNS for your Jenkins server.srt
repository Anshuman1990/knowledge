00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome back in this video we're going to be changing gears I pay the kids we're going to

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,930
start using a DNS local DNS.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:17,370
So for doing days we need to open up a notepad and we're going to click on recked click Run is that

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:22,190
minutes later when we are heater let's select the final occasion open.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,440
Let's go to your Windows partition in my case it's Windows see.

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,500
So let's look for Windows.

7
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,840
Let's look for system 32 here.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:43,650
OK let's look for drivers and drivers we click on each PC.

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:48,100
And after that here we just click on all the files.

10
00:00:48,340 --> 00:00:55,000
When we're presented to DS We're going to choose the hosts file and what we're going to do is to graph

11
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,380
the IP address that you can select from puti or from your web browser and we're going to paste that

12
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,230
AP here.

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,140
Please don't include this HDB.

14
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,020
So the IP only and after that you can give a name that you on any name it's OK.

15
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:20,980
So for now we're just going to say like Jenkin's out local and we're going to save file save after that

16
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:28,930
you can close it and you can open a new tap and you can type Jenkin's that local call on ADHD hit enter

17
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:33,690
and Magique you have not created a local DNS.

18
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
So for days we can reach Jenkin's using these.

19
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:45,380
And even we can modify our poor decision in order to change their IP and start using the DNS.

20
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,390
So if you want to you can use instead of using the IP address here you can use the DNS that we have

21
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,860
just created which is Jenkin's that local.

22
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:57,370
So I'll see you in the next PDU.
