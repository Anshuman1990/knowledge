<p>Hey, there!</p><p><br></p><p>There's a chance that your jenkins container won't come up. If you can't see your container by using<code> docker ps</code>, this will help! Otherwise, you can just ignore it :D</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Issue:</strong></p><p><code>docker ps</code> doesn't show the running container.</p><p><strong>Debug:</strong></p><p><code>docker ps</code> -a shows the container with exit status.</p><p><code>docker logs jenkins</code><strong> </strong>shows a volume permission error.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Reason:</strong></p><p>* Inside of the Jenkins container, there's a user named "jenkins" which has a Linux uid of 1000.</p><p>* You are mounting a docker volume to /var/jenkins_home which is the home directory of that user. If the directory doesn't have 1000 permissions, then the user won't be able to write/delete files, which causes the container to exit.</p><p><strong>Resolution</strong>:</p><p>Apply 1000 permissions to your jenkins-data folder, and then restart the container.</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">sudo chown 1000:1000 -R ~/jenkins-data
