00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,680
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,300
The first thing that we're going to do is we're going to create a directory which is going to be called

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,100
Jenkyns.

4
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,490
You can create it whatever you want.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:17,170
In this case the path is as large hum Jenkins and Jenkin's as you can see here.

6
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,670
I just created a directory here.

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:27,550
If a journalist here is the directory in befool pad for a directory is that current directory Pazz this

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,370
pad.

9
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:35,800
So let me just rename this directory because you may be confused so let's rename it.

10
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,210
And we're going to call that Jenkin's data for example.

11
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:48,360
So the full path for Jenkyns data is going to be less home Jenkyns and Jenkin's data perfect.

12
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,710
These directories empty as you can see because we haven't created anything but we're going to create

13
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,440
things.

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,060
OK.

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:56,620
We created the directory.

16
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,990
Now we're going to move into that directory.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:05,690
We don't have anything here but we're going to create a sample daquiri compose file.

18
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:11,920
So we're Type VII docker compose that yemo.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:12,940
This is important.

20
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,720
This name is pretty important so please keep it like this.

21
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,040
And vi is a text editor for Linux.

22
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,460
So we're going to hit enter.

23
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,980
And then we're going to start typing.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,610
Did Doc compose fire before doing a duck recomposed file is they can the script is a definition.

25
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:37,970
So here we're going to define which services we want to spin.

26
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,650
So in this case for now we want to spin a Jenkin's server.

27
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,910
So we're going to start with this file.

28
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,340
So we say Version 3 that's the current version of Duguid composed don't worry.

29
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,320
And now we say it services.

30
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:58,390
So in services we're going to define our Jenkin's server and this denken server will have some properties

31
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:06,990
so we can define the container name container name and where are you going to call it Jenkyns simple.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,690
Now we're going to define the image.

33
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,100
So is a image and then the name that is going to go here.

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,080
Is the name that we downloaded in the preview video.

35
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,610
So we type darker image.

36
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,920
And here we have the name.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,250
So we're going to copy this name.

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,380
Are going to open up again or Dr. composed file.

39
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,390
And we're going to pay these in here.

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,010
Cool.

41
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,220
Oh a pretty quick tap.

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,970
If you don't know how to exit of this crane this is pretty simple.

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,260
You hit escape then you head shift and the colon key then you press w in Q Which means right and quit.

44
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,920
So we hit enter and you are really quite cool.

45
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,820
So OK we're ready to find a container name and image Waddle's zoo in it.

46
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,490
I'm going to leave you does Tim played here and this Tom played.

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:03,130
You can actually just copy and paste it if you run right.

48
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,430
Use it or you can manually type.

49
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,630
There is no problem.

50
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,590
So we're going to find the poor it's what our good port.

51
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:17,530
So we're going to say port and we define an A right of port that we're going to say that we want to

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:27,400
expose the port of Jenkin's using the port 80 on our machine and we're going to map that port internally

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,300
to the container on port 80.

54
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,450
Don't worry we will take a look on this later.

55
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,640
What else do we need.

56
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,210
We need to Baalim what is a Baalim.

57
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:38,720
OK.

58
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:45,790
You must know that in Dharker when you create a container when you use Pin-Up your service all the data

59
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:53,680
which is within the container is going to be destroyed if you don't save that data into a volume.

60
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:02,110
So we say volumes here in this case and we're going to say OK we want to create a folder which is going

61
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,280
to be called Jenkin's folders.

62
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,600
So let's use the coring part for now.

63
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,360
Are you going to say PWT which means PWT a career path.

64
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,340
And we're going to create a folder which is going to be called Jenkin's home for example.

65
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,200
And we are going to map these for other.

66
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:21,660
OK.

67
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,040
First we need to create this folder in our machines already in a copy of this

68
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:33,340
and are you going to go out of Bam and we're going to create a directory here.

69
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,140
So we click make your home make sure you don't put the lash make Jenkin's hum.

70
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,580
Hit enter.

71
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,740
Any of you do.

72
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:49,560
Unless you should see Jenkin's home folder at the same level of the daquiri compose file.

73
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:57,550
So OK the full pop Ferdie's is the PWB which can be represented with this variable.

74
00:04:57,610 --> 00:05:02,250
You do an EC2 loops.

75
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:10,410
So this is the correct path plus your four letter to folder that you have just created and this is the

76
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,360
full path as you can see.

77
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,700
OK so where are you going to get back to work Dharker compose file.

78
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,010
And we are already defined as this is the host Baalim.

79
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,930
Now we're going to map it to a container.

80
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,280
So how do we do this within the container.

81
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:33,370
The darker image eases these folder to his tour of the file.

82
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,210
So where are you going to copy the location where you put a calling here.

83
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,360
And then we paste the location.

84
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:46,570
So we're saying OK Doctor please whatever you are right here which is going to be all of the files for

85
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,160
Jenkyns.

86
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:52,850
Please save those files in the directory that I have just created.

87
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,690
Cool.

88
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,610
And now we need to define a network.

89
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:03,840
So we say we one this to be in the network that we haven't created the network net.

90
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:12,080
So let's go here in the same text file at the same level of services where are going to create a section

91
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,570
which is going to be called networks networks.

92
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:19,740
We put a call on an underneath of these.

93
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,220
We're going to create a net network.

94
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,080
So OK we're saying Please Doctor create a network using these instruction which is going to be called

95
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,010
net and then we're going to use that here.

96
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:40,490
And where are you going to include the Jenkin's server or the Jenkyns service within the network.

97
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,630
So that's pretty cool.

98
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,680
I think this is everything we need.

99
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,120
We're going to save the file and we are done.

100
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,530
So let's recap what we just did.

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,050
And if we do that cat in the duck recomposed GMO file We're going to see that we're using a version

102
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,980
3 of Dr. compose.

103
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,590
We have defined a service.

104
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,170
Its name is Jenkins they contain our name is going to be Jenkin's the image that it's going to use as

105
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:08,640
the Jenkin's slash Jenkins image.

106
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:11,200
It's going to export the port 80 80.

107
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:15,940
It's going to save all the information in these folders that we created.

108
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:24,470
And this is going to bind the service into an Network which is called Net Envy's network is being created

109
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,170
here.
