00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,300
Hello and welcome back in this video we're going to start our service our container using doctored to

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:11,300
spin up the Jenkin's service.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:18,690
So so far we already created the doc recomposed file and we created a directory here where we're going

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,300
to save all the files.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:24,950
So remember that we define a volume here and we're saying OK Doctor please.

6
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,440
Everything that is within the container in this location please save this in this folder and this folder

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:33,120
means this folder.

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,990
So if we take a look on the folder itself we see that we don't have any data yet and that's normal because

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,780
we haven't created anything.

10
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,660
So please make sure the DS folder has proper permissions so Jenkyns can write.

11
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,350
And what do I mean by a proper permissions.

12
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,800
Make sure that that user 1000 can write to these folder.

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,560
And what's the use at 1000.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:07,200
So in Linux we have IDs and as you can see these user Jenkin's user has the user id of 1000.

15
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:16,780
So we're going to do a suit to change our 1000 call on 1000 into these folder.

16
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:21,620
So Jenkin's harm we're going to do it recursively.

17
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:31,310
So OK when you leave this you will do an L L and you are going to see that the user the Downer's Jenkyns

18
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,420
and the group is Jenkyns.

19
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:42,410
This is because the container uses the ID law of to write to any of you have an order ID you are going

20
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,230
to probably have a never.

21
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:49,720
So please make sure that you read this command before is pinning up your server.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,290
So okay we're really gave it permissions.

23
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,160
We only need to do this once.

24
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,720
I mean this time in no more.

25
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:05,970
And once we gave permissions were going to pin up this server doing a daquiri compose app Dashti and

26
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:11,960
what is going to happen here is the doctor is going to create the service reading the doc recomposed

27
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,690
the Phoenician theater and if we type.

28
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:19,830
Dr. Pierce we're going to see this server running here.

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:27,270
So this is it daquiri container behalf as Pan up our server using Duckery.

30
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,850
You can list your containers using daquiri.

31
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,640
P.

32
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,690
So as you can see this is actually working like a charm.

33
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,420
Cool.

34
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:44,780
I will type doc Curlylocks dash F and this is going to show me the locks for ascertaining container.

35
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:52,070
Remember that in our definition of the Dockerty composed file we said that the container name is Jenkin's

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:54,120
So we do a darker loves dash.

37
00:02:54,150 --> 00:03:03,210
And if Jenkins we hit enter and as you can see here this is what we are hash.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,840
We're going to use these later.

39
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:13,500
So for now what we're going to do is we're going to hit the IP address of our machine.

40
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,550
Do you remember the IP address.

41
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,560
So we're going to grab this IP we can pick up here from you remember we can click here.

42
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:25,000
Load and then we will have the AP.

43
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,790
So we're going to copy these IP and we're going to paste it into our browser so we paste it.

44
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,140
And we're going to have an error.

45
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:42,000
But if we do a call on ADHD and then we hit enter it again we are going to be a press centered on the

46
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,370
screen that tells us hey I am Jane.

47
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,510
Well finally we have Jenkyns installed and Jenkins wants to make sure that we are the owners.

48
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,160
So we need to introduce your password.

49
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,620
What's the password.

50
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,890
Well the password is pretty simple.

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,820
You go to put me here.

52
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:09,010
You do a duck Curlylocks dash F and you will see the password in here.

53
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,990
So this is the password and or even a copy of this.

54
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:19,200
Remember to copy and put in your users do a double click on the thing you want to copy and then you

55
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,670
paste it normally here you pasted and then you click on continue.

56
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,130
Pretty simple.

57
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,520
So now as you can see here we are presented with a screen that says customized denken.

58
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,290
So what do we do here.

59
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,530
I would suggest you to click on the button that says insults are just appliance.

60
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,660
We're going to click on this and Jenkyns.

61
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,880
Where you going to see these later.

62
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:49,940
Jinking has a lot of plug ins and a plug in is nothing else but like a tool an extension for something.

63
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:57,170
So Jenkyns it's quite powerful but you can still plug in in a plug in is going to give you additional

64
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,240
functionalities for Jenkyns.

65
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:06,950
So in this case we're going to install the suggested plug ins by Jenkyns because for sure we're going

66
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:09,450
to need it in the future.

67
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:15,680
So this is going to take a while because it needs to connect to the Internet and then download the files

68
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:17,960
and install them into Jenkyns.

69
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:24,110
I will pause the video and now will come back when it has finished great.

70
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,970
So did download already finished.

71
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:33,450
And now we have a screen here that tells us to create a user and as you can see here it says OK please

72
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:35,870
create the first admin user.

73
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:37,710
So we're going to call it admin.

74
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,850
Or you can call it whatever you want.

75
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,150
We're gonna give you the password.

76
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,130
Please give us trank password.

77
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,730
I will give you the one two three four one two three four.

78
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,680
And actually if you want to do for to everything.

79
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:50,430
OK.

80
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,390
So we're going to give the full name.

81
00:05:52,390 --> 00:06:00,300
Let's say that this is going to be Jenkyns at man and let's say that the male of this guy is like Jenkin's

82
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,140
at gmail dot com just to say something.

83
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:04,870
OK.

84
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,460
Don't click on the save and continue.

85
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:13,520
We click on never here and here this is going to ask for a day you are all.

86
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,230
So for now we're just going to leave it like this.

87
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:19,650
We click save and finish and then we are done.

88
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,230
Finally we click on start using Jenkyns.

89
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:28,680
And here we have the screen that allows us to lug God and lock in.

90
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:36,030
So if we click on Loog out here then we put the credentials that we created ad man and one two three

91
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:42,870
four is a puzzle where we can click on Kyp mayor saying then let's click it and then let's hit design

92
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,610
button.

93
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,510
Cool.

94
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:51,180
So here we are in the Jenkin's dashboard and then we're going to start having a lot of fun with all

95
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,170
of these features tools and icons that you can see here.

96
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,130
It's a dummys.

97
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,300
Any video.

98
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,430
And see you in the next lesson.
