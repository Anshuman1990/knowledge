<p>Hello!</p><p>Hope you enjoy the course!</p><p>I wanted to gave you a quick note. I'm building the Lab using windows, so, we're going to create a Linux VM because we will simulate a real world environment. Please, go ahead and Install VirtualBox if you are using Windows. https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads.</p><p>If you are on mac, you can skip the VM steps and jump directly to install docker for Mac. https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/</p><p>If you have Linux already installed on your pc, please use your Linux Distribution instead of the VM.</p><p>Have fun!</p>
