Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:10,860
OK guys this is a pretty quick video and I'm doing this because I've taken a look at DVD-R's and I have

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,160
seen that when we were using puti for you could be ok.

4
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,070
Bad in this case the video doesn't look good or it doesn't look pretty clear.

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,090
So what I'm going to do here is that I have already installed Ubuntu which is a subsystem for Windows.

6
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,570
If you're using Windows and you can just go ahead and install it and from now on I won't be using puti

7
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:34,370
anymore.

8
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,170
Instead I'll be using is H.

9
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,650
Jenkins.

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,950
Jenkins that low cut.

11
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:46,680
Remember that we created that DNS before he'd enter and I'll just give the puzzle one two three four.

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,710
And as you can see here DS actually works the same way that puti does.

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,420
But the thing is that here the script looks quite better and the definition is better.

14
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,130
Kids at UNO in Pudi.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,750
The colors are not good for recording videos.

16
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:08,060
So probably as you can see the difference this is why it is actually stronger.

17
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:14,500
And there's one therefore I know that you're going to like to watch this instead of watching two deputy.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,810
You can use one to install it in the Microsoft story if you want or you can keep using Pootie.

19
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:27,210
I suggest you to keep using Pootie because that's cool you are going to use it in the future or maybe

20
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,520
a job or whatever and it's cool that you know how to use boody.

21
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,420
But if you want to go ahead and use Xubuntu it's OK.

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:40,350
It's exactly the same thing we're doing and as a stage connection and that's what really mattered.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:47,340
So in here as you can see I'm connected to the Jenkin's machine that we created which is actually using

24
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,270
this IP address.

25
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,500
And this is the virtual machine that we created before.

26
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:59,940
So this is exactly the same machine that Elvie using this because you know it's actually better for

27
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,320
you to see the screen for the resolution of the videos.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,480
So when I drew on L-L you see things clearer than what you would use in Pootie.

29
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:16,000
So this is just for you to feel comfortable with the videos and I'll see you in the next lesson.
