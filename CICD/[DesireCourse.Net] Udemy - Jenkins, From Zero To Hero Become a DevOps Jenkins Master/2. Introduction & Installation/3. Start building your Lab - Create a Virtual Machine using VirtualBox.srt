00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,230
Hello and welcome back here we're going to take a look how are we going to build our love for a tree.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,010
So as you can see here I'm using Windows and probably you are going to be using Windows.

3
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,290
So.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:12,730
OK.

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,900
The first thing that we're going to do we're going to take this laboratory using a vertical box.

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,750
So if you have vertical bugs go ahead to Verd for bugs that work and install it for Windows.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,540
It's pretty simple to just download it.

8
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,710
Click next next next and then you have virtual box installed.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:34,890
So we're going to install a virtual machine a Linux machine using sento So we're going to go into centers

10
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:43,980
monumental ISO which is going to show as the ISO for center is in its minimal version.

11
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,100
So OK here we are a we have we're going to click on the first link and as you can see here it's going

12
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,230
to start downloading the image I already downloaded before.

13
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,190
So I'm going to go ahead and council lead and as you can see here DS is there.

14
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,170
Resoled.

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,920
So after we have these eyes are already downloaded.

16
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:09,460
What were we going to do that we're going to create a virtual machine based on these eyes.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,580
So for that I'll see you in the next lesson.
