1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:05,000
Kilo and welcome back OK here we already download are image.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,850
Please be sure that it image that you download.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:15,860
It's going to be sent to seven as you can see here and there it is a 64 version as you can see here.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:21,060
So OK once we have these image what we're going to do is we're going to create a virtual machine using

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,970
this image and a virtual box.

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,380
So let's go ahead and open up a little box.

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,880
We're going to click on new.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,820
Then we're going to give it a name like Jenkin's or you can name it as you want.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,190
We're going to say that the machine is Linux.

10
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,940
I think we don't have Santo's here.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,750
We don't have.

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:41,690
So we're going to use Redhat as I told you it should be 64 bit.

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:43,150
So we're going to do.

14
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,440
We're going to click next.

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:51,150
We're going to give it for now I think two gigabytes for a ram so we're going to click next.

16
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,600
We're going to create a hard disk now because we don't have any hard disk.

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,970
We're going to click and create.

18
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,260
We're going to click on next here next and we're going to give it.

19
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,180
I don't know let's give it like 20 to get bytes.

20
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,150
OK so let's we can create an OK.

21
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,770
We have already our machine created.

22
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,840
So let's go ahead to settings.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:16,690
And let's go to network ones we are here.

24
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:23,470
We need to define which adapter we are going to use so we can use as you can see here a lot of adapters

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:24,440
for discourse.

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:30,700
We're going to be using the bridge adapter so we have a Indie's rubdown as you can see here a lot of

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:39,250
adapter's via's And these are virtual adapters so we don't want these ones we could want these or this.

28
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,210
The first one which is Ethernet or the last one which is wireless depends on you.

29
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:50,320
So for example in the course of using the Ethar and connections which means that my computer is always

30
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,300
going to be connected to the network using a court or a wire it means that the connection is going to

31
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:05,320
be always the ethernet connection or if you know that your computer is always using Wi-Fi then you should

32
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,220
bind your virtual machine to wireless.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,570
It depends on you.

34
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,240
Please make sure that the connection that you specify here is always active whenever you turn on your

35
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,190
virtual machine.

36
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,140
So for now as you can see here I will be choosing an ethernet connection and then clicking OK.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,030
And then we're going to click on unstored.

38
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:32,980
So after we click on it our machine is going to boot up it's going to start and we will need to select

39
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,320
a startup disk.

40
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,690
So as you may guess we're going to use the ISO that we downloaded previously or are you going to go

41
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,400
into downloads and we're going to look for it centers.

42
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,720
This is the one that we downloaded with click on start then OK it's powering up.

43
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:57,730
As I told you before if your if you are not using Windows then you can just skip these videos and use

44
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,730
your Linux desktop.

45
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,110
But if you have Windows then you should keep with these ideas.

46
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:03,870
OK.

47
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,190
So what we're going to do here is that we're going to use the rules of the keyword to select installs

48
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,930
and those ones we're here Anner and we we.

49
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,310
So let's wait until something appears on the screen.

50
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:29,530
Cool as you can see here you have the welcome page and you have in these left side hand.

51
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:36,340
You have the language so we're going to use English for these keywords and here let's just click and

52
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:39,370
continue so this is cool.

53
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:45,070
Once you click on continue then we're going to have these ice cream here where we need to configure

54
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,190
a couple of things.

55
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,660
As you can see here on this software it's selection.

56
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:55,640
This is a specified as a minimal installation cool that we go into the installation.

57
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,800
What I click on here and we're going to use the automatically partition because it's OK just for testing.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:09,130
So we're going to click on Don and then we're going to go into the network and we're going to see the

59
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:15,160
Ethernet the aperture that we created before and we're going to just turn these on as you can see it

60
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:22,150
actually retrieves an IP enth and we're gonna use this IP address in the future.

61
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,980
So for now we're done with this list click done.

62
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:31,780
And finally after we have configure everything that is needed we're going to hit the begin installation

63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,430
button.

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,610
So we hit this and then we're going to create a password.

65
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:42,290
So for now I'm just going to say one two three four one two three four.

66
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:42,860
OK.

67
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:46,450
And we're going to click on done twice.

68
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:47,370
OK.

69
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:52,510
Now I don't know if we need to create a user let's create a user Let's say I want to create a user which

70
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:59,610
is going to call Jenkin's McHale and Jenkins and we're going to make these user.

71
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:05,790
And that means Strader because we want these user to be able of using sudo.

72
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,100
So we mark this and then we're going to give you the password.

73
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,740
We're you going to say one two three four again one two three four and then we're gonna click on Don.

74
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:25,180
So now the only one thing that we need to do is just to wait until this installation gets completed.

75
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,580
And after that we will have our machine ready.

76
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:33,100
So we kind of start playing around with Jenkin's that are Amazon and more.

77
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,500
So let's wait until these installation finishes.

78
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:43,360
I will puzzle you and I will come back once it has finished cool.

79
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,920
So these are already finished.

80
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:51,370
So the only one thing that is left is that not when you click this reboot button and then our machine

81
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,870
is going to rebuild.

82
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,780
So let's get it.

83
00:05:53,850 --> 00:06:00,730
Let's click on Rivard and then we need to wait until the machine boots up and then we're going to be

84
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,970
ready to start playing around with Jenkyns.

85
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,870
See you in the next lesson.
