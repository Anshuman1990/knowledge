00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:06,440
Hello and welcome back here we're going to have a look at the Jenkyns you guys so you can get used to

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,870
this because we're going to be using these a lot.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:13,930
So let's give the admin user that we created 1 2 3 4 for the password.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,860
And let's click on the kibbitzing bottom line again and then you're going to see this screen for the

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,500
Jenkyns dashboard.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,150
OK this is perfect.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,540
So here we are.

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:30,920
And let me introduce you to Jenkin's dash for it and we have here a lot of options that we're going

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,410
to look in the future in these cores.

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,490
So here you have an icon which is for creating new items new tasks and more.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,870
We have a lot of styles here.

12
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,430
Don't worry we will have sections for days.

13
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:53,360
Here we have people it means who is actually allowed to log in to do things to create jobs to deliver

14
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,390
jobs where you can configure everything and you are going to learn how to create users restrict permissions

15
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,620
and more.

16
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:02,420
Here we have a real history.

17
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:09,770
Our tasks have histories So here we're going to see the performance we're going to see how many tests

18
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,880
fail how many task when succeeded and more.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,430
So here we have managed Jenkin's icon.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:22,020
We have more things don't worry about this error we're going to fix it in the future.

21
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:28,020
This is because our DNA is here we have the system we have things for it.

22
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,230
Configuring security for configuring credentials to install plugins.

23
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:37,800
We have a lot of things here and we're going to go through all of these in decors.

24
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:45,470
So here we have more things like credentials to manage sensitive data like passwords keys or more and

25
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,600
well I think this is that.

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,530
Q summarize for the Jenkins dashboard.

27
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,680
So in the next video we're going to start playing around with all of this items and we're going to learn

28
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,970
how to use them.

29
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,330
So see you in the next lesson.
