00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,660
Hello and welcome back in this video we're going to make things harder.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,260
I mean now we're going to apply a little bit of logic to on the script.

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,020
So we're going to have conditions.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,380
So the first thing that we're going to do is that we're going to if you're in the container Let's go

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,090
out of the container and let's keep modifying this crib that we created before.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:32,340
So here we're going to add a third pedometer which is going to be like show and then the thing is that

7
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,170
these pedometer it's going to be a boolean value.

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:37,500
So it could be true or false.

9
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:45,030
And then we're going to say if this parameter is true then you are going to print the name and the last

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,290
name for that person.

11
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,590
Let me show you here.

12
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:57,750
If we go ahead and configure our JOP and we add a new parameter which is going to be boolean parameter

13
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,220
you can see that this is going to ask you for a name.

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,420
So we're going to name a shoe.

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,460
And the default value if we mark this it's going to be true if we don't mark this it's going to be false.

16
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,070
Right.

17
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,640
So this is what we're doing here.

18
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,090
We're saying show it's going to be Vishu.

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,180
These parameter that we are passing here we're going to delete this second name here.

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,280
We're only going to use three parameters Ferdie's BDO.

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:30,420
We're going to use the first name of the person the last name which is a list and then the show parameter

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,490
which is a Boolean parameter.

23
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:39,020
So OK we have here the name remembered Remember we already know how to pass parameters to on a script.

24
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,050
So in this case as Loizzo before this is going to be the first parameter second parameter and third

25
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:44,930
pedometer.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,930
So we're going to apply a little bit of logic here and we're going to say f the variable show.

27
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:58,230
So we say like this equals two I'm just going to put it in zero on the string.

28
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,260
I don't remember how that comes from Jenkins.

29
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:06,110
Let's design a string and then let's say Van echo Hello.

30
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,960
Name a last name.

31
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,080
So what are we doing here.

32
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,980
We are as kin if the verbal issue which is the third parameter is equal to true.

33
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,370
Then we are going to print the name and the last name.

34
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:26,970
But what happens if this condition doesn't meet then we do our nails here and we are going to print

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,700
never.

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:34,470
So we're going to say something like If you want to see the name then the

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:44,440
PLEASE CHOOSE THE SHOW option please.

38
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,830
Let's see.

39
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,560
Please Mark.

40
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,120
Sure.

41
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,090
Option.

42
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,280
Ok cool.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,200
And then we close the F here.

44
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:53,110
Nice.

45
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,440
So if we now execute these scrape What do you think that is going to happen.

46
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,260
Well the first thing that is going to happen is that these guys strainers if you want to say the name

47
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,710
please mark the show option but we don't have any.

48
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,570
Show up here but don't worry because this is is going to be executed from Jenkins.

49
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:20,300
So what happens if we pass here and name him and if we pass the last name and if we pass falls this

50
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,430
is we're going to see if you want to see the name please mark to show option.

51
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,820
Ok but what happens if we pass here.

52
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,600
True.

53
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,750
What you see is that now this creep is printing the name because the condition is been met.

54
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:38,160
And in this case the third parameter that show parameter is true.

55
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:43,190
So let me show you this creep once again and this is our logic.

56
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,300
So remember that here in Jenkin's we have just created at parameter within name of show which is going

57
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:56,300
to be the third parameter for our script and the default value for this case is going to be true because

58
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:00,640
we mark this if we just uncheck this and it's going to become.

59
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,090
So let's keep it like true.

60
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:06,020
And now the hours crib is working good.

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:11,720
We're going to copy this script to our container remember that we're outside of the containers so let's

62
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,150
keep this to the same location as before.

63
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:21,960
So if you hit CON-TROLL and the key are at the same time you're going to have something like filtering

64
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,520
here for searching.

65
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:29,980
Then you can type like C.P and you're going to have one command related to your input.

66
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:37,010
So in this case we want to do this again copy descript that we created or that we modify to the Jenkin's

67
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,470
container in this path.

68
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,510
So let's copy this.

69
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:46,390
Let's go ahead and exec into the container and let's look for a temp script.

70
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,720
And as you can see all our modifications are in place.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:59,600
So cool let's go ahead and then let's see how the execution would look like we're in it to execute these

72
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:05,410
full path then pass one parameter to parameters and three parameters.

73
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,970
Q If we don't pass the third parameter or if we proceed as false then it's not going to show it nice.

74
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:17,410
So we're going to do this we're going to copy these thing here and we're going to pay this in artwork

75
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,370
shell.

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,130
So this is our script then.

77
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,230
This is not going to be my name.

78
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:30,410
This is going to refer to the name of the first parameter which is named know it's first name.

79
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,730
The first parameter that is coming from Jenkyns.

80
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:41,580
So let's say learn sign first name and then this is going to be the last name the name of the parameter

81
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:47,140
remembers or we're going to choose this and we're going to pay is using here.

82
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,540
And then these falls is going to be nothing else but this show pedometer.

83
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,370
So we go here do a lot of science and show.

84
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:02,030
So remember this is the first parameter that we're defining and not on our script.

85
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:08,140
If we do a cat tamps script you're going to see that name for its parameter last name second parameter

86
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,100
and show third parameter first second and third.

87
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,050
It's pretty cool.

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,810
OK so now we click on the safe that we can build with parameters.

89
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:24,950
So as you can see now we have the first name which is a string parameter and we can call it like John.

90
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,640
And then we have the last name that we can say do for example from the list.

91
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:37,370
And then we have this show so remember when you mark this this is going to be true when you don't mark

92
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,130
this this is going to be.

93
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,600
So in this case let's keep it like folds and let's hit the Beeld button.

94
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:49,840
And once the execution finishes you're going to go to the number console output.

95
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,260
And then you are going to see the error here which says if you want to see the name please mark the

96
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,180
show option.

97
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,270
OK.

98
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,340
So we're going to execute it back.

99
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,000
We're going to mark this show option.

100
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,870
We're going to choose a random last name from here.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,770
Click on the build button and once the execution finishes we can go to the number console output and

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,120
Magique you have here your output.

103
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,020
Hello your name and your last name.

104
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,280
So remember that everything has been handled by this crypt.

105
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,720
The only one thing that Jenkins is doing is providing Debelle used to populate this information and

106
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,390
then based on the logic that we've viewed here then Jenkins is going to display whatever we want to

107
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,290
beat his play.

108
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,600
So this is pretty cool.

109
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,200
You already know how to create some parameters like strappings lists booleans.

110
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,500
Now you know how to integrate all of those parameters.

111
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:54,630
Now you know how to create a script and include those parameters so you can retrieve the value from

112
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,040
Jenkin and then pass those values to your script.

113
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,990
That is pretty cool for now.

114
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,310
So see you in the next lesson.
