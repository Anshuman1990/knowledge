00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,250
Hello and welcome back in this video we're going to learn how to use parameters in Jenkin's.

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,230
So if you remember in the previous VDU we were creating parameters in bash so we were passing those

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,580
parameters coded.

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:22,770
So if we go to the configuration of our job and we take cure if we wanted to modify a parameter we would

5
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:29,400
need to change the parameter to for example something like Tom and then a last name which could be Smith

6
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:37,320
for example and then if I click on Save and then I build now the Joffe The output that we could expect

7
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,740
is something like Hello ton's med and that's perfect.

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,320
That's what we were expecting.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,990
But what happens if we don't want to count your day job to change the parameter.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,090
We want to be able of dynamically set the name that we want to greet.

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:01:02,130
So let's go ahead and configure our project and in these part is where the concept of parameter in jinking

12
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,090
comes in to their rescue.

13
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,430
So if we go here in the first section in that general section of that configuration for a day job we're

14
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,040
going to see a lot of options here.

15
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:22,940
But for now we are just going to choose the option that says this project is parametrized and then we're

16
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,100
going to add a parameter which is praise.

17
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,380
We have a lot of parameters here.

18
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,450
Don't worry we will see them later.

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:37,460
But for now let's use unnormal the string pedometer because for now we all want to pass the name and

20
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:40,580
the last name for the person that we want to get.

21
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,160
So let's say that we want the name to be name.

22
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,360
So this means the name of the pedometer.

23
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:55,520
In this case we want to call it as name so let's call it different that you can see it first name for

24
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,540
example and then we can give a default value if we want.

25
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:04,430
If we don't want don't we just leave it empty Let's go ahead and give it a default dollar with my name

26
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:12,200
and now we're going to add a second parameter strength barometer again and we're going to now use a

27
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,430
second name of that person.

28
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:19,530
So it was a second name and that we can give it that the full value.

29
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,960
So in my case let's give you my second name.

30
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,720
As you can see here.

31
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:31,160
So there is something that I want you to check here and this is the name the name means the name of

32
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,620
the verb for the name of the parameter.

33
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,290
So we're going to be referencing these names in our scripts.

34
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,450
So for example we're going to say hello first name and then it's going to take the value and then we

35
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,780
can say hello second name and then it's going to take this value.

36
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:56,540
So let's go down and let's modify our current configuration let's select diesel and let's run a simple

37
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:04,430
hello to the name that we are passing as a parameter so we can see EKU Halo and then we're passing a

38
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:13,390
first name parameter that we create it and then we can pass the second name parameter that we created.

39
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:19,530
So if you see these are the names that we're using first name and second name so cool.

40
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,270
We are saying hello first name and second name.

41
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,240
So let's go ahead and save this.

42
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,370
And now if you see the Bubo already change it now is built with parameters.

43
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,820
And what's going to happen if before executing the job.

44
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:41,840
It's going to ask for these pedometers So here is the first parameter that we created.

45
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,390
And here is the second named parameter we created.

46
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:51,100
So we can just leave the default value so you can see here and let's click on the build button.

47
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,460
So if you see the console output of this you're going to say this is not the up.

48
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,170
Is the third.

49
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:04,460
In my bed if you go here and you go to the console output you are going to see that Hello Ricardo which

50
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,770
is my first name and second name.

51
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:11,840
Cool but what happens if now we want to read not a person that's going to be easy but we're going to

52
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,100
say for example Hello Tom and then do that the second name I don't know that say Adam or something like

53
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,500
that.

54
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:22,260
And then click on Vote Now.

55
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,930
So you're going to see this is pending.

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,020
And cool.

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,900
We already have this execution.

58
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,910
So let's go to the console output.

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:37,280
And as you can see the name already change only by modifying their parameter before executing the job.

60
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:44,740
So Vael Dean jobs with parameter is actually quite powerful because we can divine the names or divert

61
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,460
eyeballs or files or parameters the hours that should execute without modifying the configuration of

62
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,020
the job.

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:01,700
So this for example we could define an environment like production here or def or Q A or staging or

64
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,240
whatever.

65
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,650
We can just create all the parameters that we want.

66
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:12,870
But for now let's keep in mind that a parameter is nothing else but an interactive verbal.

67
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:21,020
So before you build your job Jenkins is going to ask you for these values in order to populate the information

68
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,340
that is contained on the script that Jenkins is going to execute.

69
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:27,530
So this is it for this video.

70
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,490
See you in the next lesson.
