1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,520
Kilo and work him back.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,980
So in this video we're going to be playing weed our job off they job that we created in the previous

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,030
lesson.

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,190
And I just wanted to tell you that you can go to the Jenkin's home whenever you want.

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,740
Clicking on the Jenkin's button here.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,970
So we're going to click in the name of our job and we're going to go into the configure section.

7
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:29,590
And as you can see we're again presented with this a screen that has all of that configuration.

8
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,830
And this is our current configuration.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,110
So we're going to make this job more dynamic.

10
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,200
In Linux we have a cool command which is the date command.

11
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:43,500
So let's head to our virtual machine let's go inside of that container.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,780
Remember that we are outside of the container because if we type Ducker P.S. We can see the container.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:53,140
So we're going to go to the container except Dashti.

14
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:57,470
Jenkins Bash and here we are within the container as you can see.

15
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,610
This crane looks different.

16
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:06,250
So if we type in the date command here as you can see we have an output and that output is nothing else

17
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,030
but the current date and time.

18
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,970
So there is actually that it returns day command.

19
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:20,290
But what happens if you want to execute this command and I want to have text with this command for example

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:25,660
I want to say the date is and then I want that result of these date.

21
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,590
So how do I do this in Linux.

22
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:35,320
That's pretty easy employ you use the echo command and then you type your string like for example current

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:38,980
date is and then you want to execute the commands.

24
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,440
How do you execute the command.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,780
You put Azango are here and then you put parentheses within the parentheses.

26
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,580
You'd type the command through on is good for example.

27
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:54,810
And as you can see it say it's current date is and it returns the value of the date.

28
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,210
Come on.

29
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,150
Which is pretty useful for doing whatever you want to.

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,440
I could say a note or a command like QMI for example and they could change.

31
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,930
You know they command and I want to say who am I.

32
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,740
For example.

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,770
And as you can see it's actually given the same text but returning different values based on the command

34
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,380
that I'm executing here.

35
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:26,220
So let's keep it like this with the date current date is this that's a current date and time cool.

36
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:30,710
So this command is actually awesome So we're going to copy this command.

37
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,380
And as you saw here on the job definition we have a shell.

38
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,920
So this is actually the same shell as this one so you can freely copy and paste the command that we

39
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,660
typed in the previous terminal in this terminal.

40
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,560
And this is going to work the same way.

41
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:55,520
So let's click on the safe and once you have that configure you click on Bill now and then you go to

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,750
that job.

43
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:04,950
Console output and then you see the output of the is which says current time current date and time is

44
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,890
the output of Dick Kamen.

45
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:08,910
Cool isn't it.

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,240
So for example here you are saying at 37 which is the second.

47
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,740
So let's hit big old ones again and let's see if there is any difference.

48
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,450
Where are you going to go here into debil history.

49
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,780
Job number four.

50
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,950
Click on console output and heater.

51
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,530
We're going to see that the day actually change the second change so there's means that Jenkyns is actually

52
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,450
being execute in their command.

53
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,250
Whenever we ask for it.

54
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,290
So this is pretty cool.

55
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:42,370
You already know how to use linux command within your.

56
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,500
Jenkins Yup and printed with text which is pretty useful sometimes.

57
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,740
So I'll see you in the next lesson.
