00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,280
Hello and welcome back in this video we're going to learn how to create a list pedometer in our Jenkin's

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:07,890
job.

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:14,320
So whenever we come to build but it's going to show up at least we can choose the value that we want.

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,170
So two are any parameter we click the Add parameter button and we choose.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,890
In this case choice pedometer.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,810
So we're going to give it a name which can be like last name for example any humor.

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,920
We're going to give choices.

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,570
So let's say the first last name is going to be like Smith.

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,830
Second one is going to be my last name.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:41,680
One is going to be our random one and that's it.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:49,200
Cool here in this case we have a parameter which is called last name in the list of values.

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,770
So depending on which value they use or picks up then these variables are going to take that value.

13
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,160
So let's make it clearer for example.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,180
Now we have the first name now we have the second name.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,400
And now what we need to do here is say like last name.

16
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:11,970
So let's save this and let's click can be permanent as you can see here we still have the first name

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,930
parameter which is a String parameter.

18
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,820
SECOND NAME IS the string parameters.

19
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:21,990
Well but if you want the last name that we just create is a list and if we click on this list we are

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,490
going to see the allowed Balios that we created before.

21
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,410
So the user can only choose one of these values.

22
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,690
So let's go ahead and use the last one.

23
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:38,280
And as you can see let's just give a random name here and click on Byard once the execution finishes

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,800
you are going to go here.

25
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,180
Cancel our booth and then you are going to see your hello.

26
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:51,060
The first parameter second Paramor and a third parameter that is the result of they choose another option

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:52,760
by that user.

28
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,220
So as you could see we choose they do last name as the value for this parameter so let's click for example

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:06,540
in this let's hit built in after the execution finishes we're going to go into the output.

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,590
And as you can see here this group is actually taking the values that we are sending which is pretty

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:14,040
good.

32
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,580
So cool.

33
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,030
You already know how to create a string parameters.

34
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,790
How to you create list parameters and how to make your Jenkyns job to print those values.

35
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,080
This is pretty cool.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,570
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT LIST.

37
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:26,750
And.
