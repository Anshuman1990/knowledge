00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,790
Hello and welcome back OK in this video we're going to create our first map.

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:08,240
It's not going to be your job.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:13,650
It's going to be pretty simple because it's our first job in the future we're going to do more interesting

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:14,490
things.

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,410
So to create a job we can either click here or create a new item.

6
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,720
So let's click on to create new item and now we need to give it a name.

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,480
So let's say that we want this job to be called my first job.

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,670
That was my first job.

9
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,960
We're going to click and freestyle project which is a simple project and we click OK.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:46,130
After this you're going to see there's a screen with all of these can be green.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:51,820
Don't worry I know it could be like overwhelming or something but it's pretty simple.

12
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:57,230
So the first thing that we're going to do or a difference in that I want you to keep in mind is that

13
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:00,360
a task is in Jenkin's called a job.

14
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:09,620
So you're probably going to see everywhere people using the concept of job in a job is nothing but a

15
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:12,540
task something that is going to be done.

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,280
That's a job.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,390
So we're configuring here a job or a task.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,030
But the concept in Jenkyns is a job.

19
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:26,200
So here in the Bills section we're going to build Stabb and we're going to look for execute command.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,100
So I want to show you one thing and this is that these shil refers to our virtual machine but not entirely

21
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:35,630
to our virtual machine.

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:44,240
Remember that we created at container in here and these container actually has the Jenkin's service

23
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:45,500
up and running.

24
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,980
But if we look in our machine I mean outside of the container there is no Jenkin's server.

25
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,580
We don't even have Java installed as you can see.

26
00:01:54,830 --> 00:02:01,850
But if we go inside of their container doing the correct section Dashti Jenkin's and asking for a bus

27
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:09,020
terminal we hit enter and if we type Java you are going to see that we have Javins or heater we can

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,900
even do a Java Dasch version and we have a Java insult within the container.

29
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:15,510
So let's make this clear.

30
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:23,420
We have our virtual machine which is nothing else but like the house of that container and that container

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,160
which can be placed using Dr APF is the service itself.

32
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:36,210
So as you can see when we do our Duckery except the terminal actually changes it's a perience.

33
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:44,080
For example in the creative file coach Hello slash stamp slash hello you're going to see that this file

34
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,110
is is going to be created only within that container.

35
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:48,910
Hello.

36
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:55,070
But if we go out of that container and we look for the same file these file doesn't exist.

37
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:59,430
So please keep in mind that everything that's going to happen and.

38
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,270
Jenkins Yup we'll look cure within their container.

39
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,320
I mean we've seen the darker expect Dashti.

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,090
It's not going to happen outside.

41
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:15,910
Not here but everything up would around every command anything is going to be running within that container.

42
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,560
It's time to start running our job.

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:27,540
So let's say echo Hello world which is you know the most popular cool for beginners in technology.

44
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,870
So let's click on Save here in after we say if that's click on.

45
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:38,350
Now they're built but on means viewed in a project so for now if we go here.

46
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:45,380
Console output we are going to see that our job executed took says Phlip printin.

47
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,760
Hello world.

48
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:53,140
So remember what we just did is to create and configure Jopp.

49
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:59,050
We added it step here as show step and then we said take him in kill hill work.

50
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,030
We saved this and then we clicked on the Beeld Nah burning.

51
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,160
So here we have a bill history we can just go into the number of the execution that we want to know.

52
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,940
Click on the console.

53
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:19,040
And then we have these output which means that the job executed correctly.

54
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,010
So you already created your first.

55
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:22,010
Yup cool.

56
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,070
Remember these job has been executed within the container not outside.

57
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,890
So having said this.

58
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,080
See you in the next lesson.
