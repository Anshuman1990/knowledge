00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,040
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,710
In this lecture I wanted to talk a little bit about how the class is organized.

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,320
The reason I wanted to provide this quick short lecture is so that it can help you better decide on

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,110
whether or not you want to sign up for the class purchase the class.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,640
So this class is a little different than many of the classes on you dummy and that it's not just a how

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,180
to.

7
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:31,610
This class is organized around explaining all the concepts of programming language.

8
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:37,250
It's really focused on the why in addition to providing the how I'm going to provide many how tos on

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:41,180
how to write certain programs and demonstrate different concepts.

10
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:46,700
But again it's a little unique in that it's just not a how to you're going to understand concepts you're

11
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,210
going to understand why you're doing the things you're doing when you're writing your code.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:55,100
So it's a complete learning experience at the end of this class you're going to fully understand the

13
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:01,580
program language specifically you're going to understand how the programming language works and all

14
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:04,380
the concepts associated with that language.

15
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,480
And again as I mentioned earlier I find this is lacking in many of the Udemy courses.

16
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:17,990
Many of the NUMMI courses are nothing more than demonstrations of projects of of certain how tos on

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:25,130
how to create a particular coding project without fully understanding what you're doing or why you're

18
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,660
doing it.

19
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,550
I also want to describe how I'm going to present this information and how you're going to learn it.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:37,040
First and foremost we're going to have all video lectures you know that policy and you dummy is mainly

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,290
that the way they can provide a lot of some of the exact some of the material is going to provide it

22
00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:46,780
through PowerPoint slides and some people are negative on PowerPoint slides.

23
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,180
They don't really like to learn from PowerPoint slides.

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,380
They're just real not keen on it.

25
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,140
The reason I provide PowerPoint slides is because I have to provide these concepts and definitions often

26
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:06,640
is the case and they're very abstract and I can't just go into an idea and demonstrate the code.

27
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,130
I have to provide the content some kind of text.

28
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,480
Now I could provide that notepad word pad.

29
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:20,150
Any other editor I choose PowerPoint slide PowerPoint because it has a nice visual representation and

30
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,870
it's very useful in that manner.

31
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:26,900
I'm not going to just be reading from the slides so I will hear some complaints often in other classes

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,710
where hey you're using PowerPoint slides and you just going to read from them.

33
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,470
Well no I'm not just going to read from them.

34
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm going to provide insight via my experience.

35
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:41,300
So the PowerPoint slides again they're designed to provide for you the understanding of the material.

36
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:47,270
I'm not sure any other way I can do that without providing at least some PowerPoint slides especially

37
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,490
concerning abstract concepts and definitions.

38
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,700
I just don't know no other way to do it.

39
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,340
You have to listen and you have to try to understand from it.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,300
Now that doesn't mean we're going to not going to provide other concepts of learning but there are going

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,430
to be PowerPoint slides so I understand that coming in the class.

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,300
And these are going to contain thorough explanations VMI experience.

43
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,060
It's a way for you to understand the concepts in the class.

44
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,820
It's not the only thing that I'm to provide but you are going to see a PowerPoint slide.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,600
So don't just necessarily get negative on the entire class because there are PowerPoint slides.

46
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,090
It's one technique in helping you learn.

47
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:28,550
And I think a technique that needs that is needed in the class in addition to the PowerPoint slides.

48
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,320
I'm going to do tons of practical hands on demonstrations of code.

49
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,640
So I'm going to bring up the idea I'm going to bring up an editor I'm going to show you how to write

50
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,400
the code in an editor.

51
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,190
I'm write code examples I'm going to type in the code.

52
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,260
These are gonna be concrete.

53
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:48,170
They're gonna be real world so if this this type of learning will be more practical and we'll be more

54
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,360
hands on learning.

55
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,040
And I know many students like this and it's needed.

56
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,200
I love it because it's more practical and actually see you can see how I'm writing code.

57
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,350
Again though if I'm if I'm trying to present information or concepts such as polymorphism I also want

58
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:07,880
to provide a lecture or a PowerPoint slide associate with that to give you a formal definition so that

59
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,630
we don't just dive into the code and then you have to kind of scratch your head and say what exactly

60
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,890
is he doing in the code.

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,710
So pi point slides in addition and demonstrations are gonna be provided in this class.

62
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:22,460
This will help supplement your learning of the language itself.

63
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,070
In addition you need a way to assess how well you're doing in the class in what you're learning and

64
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:33,470
if you're learning so we're going to provide challenges challenges that are essentially coding assignments

65
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,830
through additional projects how it will work is provide you with this assignment.

66
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:44,630
I'll tell you the requirements explain maybe give you some tips on how to complete the challenge and

67
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,360
then you'll go off and do it on your own.

68
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,800
And then I'll provide another video which will be a solution to that lecture so you can see whether

69
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,660
or not you did it correctly.

70
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:58,910
The solution will be a complete walkthrough or what is called a code along of the solution.

71
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,860
I'll go line by line explaining every line of the solution in an integrated developed environment in

72
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,920
an environment where you write your code I'll run it.

73
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,900
I'll demonstrate how it works.

74
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:09,700
Everything.

75
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,800
And then addition to going through this video walkthrough I'll also provide all the source code to you

76
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:22,880
so that you can download it and you can compare the source code to your source code in text but again

77
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,870
I wanted to just provide this quick lecture so that you know how the class is organized in terms of

78
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:29,730
how you're going to learn and what you're paying for.

79
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,450
And if you see a lot of PowerPoint slides try to give you an idea of why provide them and why I think

80
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:37,070
they're useful.

81
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,500
Again I want to provide a complete learning environment and I don't think I can do that by just doing

82
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,900
a how to of walking through projects.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:50,590
So I hope you appreciate this lecture and I hope you understand where I'm coming from and how you're

84
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
going to learn in this class.

85
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:51,830
Thank you.
