00:00.970 --> 00:06.320
In this lecture we will be discussing why many Microcircuits projects fail.

00:07.330 --> 00:10.910
Now failure can mean many different things.

00:10.930 --> 00:17.860
So for example it can mean that the project failed to be delivered on time or failed to reach certain

00:17.860 --> 00:26.060
requirements such as may be scalability or in the worst case when the project was not delivered at all.

00:27.080 --> 00:34.190
Apart from the normal risk factors and projects which are outside the area of control of the development

00:34.190 --> 00:35.580
perspective.

00:35.630 --> 00:41.660
Esther beaute many failures in micro-chip is this projects to a combination of the following factors

00:42.940 --> 00:50.470
lack of planning is a common factor as micro services tend to take more development effort than if a

00:50.470 --> 00:58.580
similar system had been developed in other architectures such as may be multi-tiered architecture.

00:58.740 --> 01:05.880
There could also be design and implementation issues caused by a combination of lack of knowledge of

01:05.880 --> 01:12.100
how to implement Microcircuits properly and lack of actual experience and skills in doing so.

01:14.030 --> 01:20.210
In many development projects there also tends to be an underestimation in the additional development

01:20.630 --> 01:28.470
deployment monitoring and configuration of micro services and their interprocess communication infrastructure.

01:29.430 --> 01:36.540
These reasons all tend to stem from lack of experience in managing Microcircuits related projects and

01:36.540 --> 01:37.750
their implementation.

01:38.160 --> 01:45.030
And as a result they assume that implementing a Microcircuits based system is very similar to developping

01:45.030 --> 01:52.050
some of their web service they've implemented in the past without realising the added resources and

01:52.050 --> 01:58.570
time needed due to the higher number of micro services required to build a complex system.

02:00.560 --> 02:07.700
To prevent micro service based projects from failing it is important to ensure that the project you

02:07.700 --> 02:12.590
are designing is applicable to the macro service architecture.

02:12.600 --> 02:18.360
I highly recommend that you prioritise automation in all aspects possible.

02:18.360 --> 02:25.860
This includes continuous integration deployments and also creating Microcircuits templates which we'll

02:25.860 --> 02:28.280
be discussing in future lectures.

02:29.500 --> 02:36.970
It's also important to have a clear plan and this means not only having proper design of the system

02:37.330 --> 02:45.040
but also estimating the time required to develop the different micro services correctly to create and

02:45.050 --> 02:48.200
plan a realistic and manageable shed yule.

02:49.880 --> 02:58.340
Finally and perhaps this is the most important point is to avoid common pitfalls by falling into untyped

02:58.440 --> 03:05.300
terms which are usually the cause by taking the design decisions without proper knowledge of their impact

03:05.450 --> 03:07.180
on a micro service architecture.

03:08.670 --> 03:15.180
We'll be going to all the most important patterns in discourse to help make sure that you have the tools

03:15.420 --> 03:19.340
to design and micro services based system effectively.
