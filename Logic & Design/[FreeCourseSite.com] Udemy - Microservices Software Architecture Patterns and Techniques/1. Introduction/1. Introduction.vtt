00:00.930 --> 00:03.170
Hello and welcome to the course.

00:03.360 --> 00:10.730
Micro services software architecture patterns and techniques in discourse.

00:10.730 --> 00:14.690
You will learn about micro services architecture.

00:14.690 --> 00:21.950
You will learn to identify technical challenges and common pitfalls in developing a microchip based

00:21.950 --> 00:29.540
system and how to properly implement software architecture patterns for a distributed system to allow

00:29.540 --> 00:33.940
for scalability was 20 an inconsistency.

00:33.950 --> 00:40.910
You will also learn techniques to help people in the design development deployment and also monitoring

00:41.180 --> 00:49.840
of your micro serviced based system discourse is ideal for software developers who are currently developing

00:50.040 --> 00:57.880
a microchip system software developers or thinking of refectory in their current system to micro services

00:58.630 --> 01:06.100
software architects who want to improve their skills in designing micro services and anyone who wants

01:06.100 --> 01:13.600
to learn about micro services and gain in that technical knowledge on how to design structure and develop

01:14.050 --> 01:15.910
service based systems.

01:17.750 --> 01:24.950
The course is structured around video tutorials explaining in detail the different technical skills

01:25.220 --> 01:32.120
and architecture patterns that are necessary to design and develop as scalable and robust micro service

01:32.120 --> 01:33.740
based system.

01:33.740 --> 01:40.130
There will also be an assignment in each section to help you gain expertise and understanding of the

01:40.130 --> 01:43.220
concept we are learning about.

01:43.230 --> 01:48.100
I am also available to answer any questions you may have.

01:48.100 --> 01:52.800
I look forward to seeing you in discourse and to hearing your feedback.

01:52.840 --> 01:55.510
Once you've begun going through the lectures.
