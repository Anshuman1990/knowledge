00:00.730 --> 00:08.010
In this lecture we will be learning about the purpose and implementation of the health check API which

00:08.010 --> 00:12.190
we have discussed in previous lectures.

00:12.380 --> 00:21.450
The magic API is a route that should be available on services that expose an API endpoint this route

00:21.640 --> 00:25.500
can be created to update the service status.

00:25.640 --> 00:30.440
The standard response schools that are generally used are two hundred.

00:30.470 --> 00:31.160
OK.

00:31.160 --> 00:38.570
If the service is healthy and the five hundred response code if the service is in an air state however

00:38.930 --> 00:45.980
custom responses can also be added if you'd like to include more information to the consumers of the

00:45.980 --> 00:47.420
head check API.

00:48.860 --> 00:56.010
The health check API is usually called frequently by services such as the service registry to check

00:56.130 --> 00:59.970
if the service is still available to direct traffic to it.

01:00.060 --> 01:09.220
As we discussed in the earlier lectures it is also commonly used by monitoring services in order to

01:09.220 --> 01:14.560
raise alerts if the service is created are in an unhealthy state.

01:16.220 --> 01:22.770
As the head of the API is something that will behave similarly across all services and should be included

01:23.010 --> 01:27.180
in all micro services exposing an API endpoint.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.860
It is a good candidate for a model to be included in the Microcircuits template.
