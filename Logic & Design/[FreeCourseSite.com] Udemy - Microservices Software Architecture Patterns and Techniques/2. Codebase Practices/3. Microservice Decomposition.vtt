00:03.400 --> 00:10.470
In this picture would be learning about how to decompose system into several micro services perhaps

00:10.470 --> 00:11.830
the most important thing.

00:11.830 --> 00:18.410
To keep in mind when designing the structure of micro services is that these should be mostly coupled

00:18.570 --> 00:25.620
from each other but you have high cohesion meaning that each micro service will contain only things

00:25.740 --> 00:28.330
that are strongly related to each other.

00:29.450 --> 00:36.200
We should also keep in mind what is known as the common closure Principle which states that things that

00:36.200 --> 00:38.710
often change do gooder should be prickish to.

00:39.610 --> 00:46.600
This will help in facilitating deployments as if to reduce the number of services that need to be deployed

00:46.630 --> 00:47.740
for each change.

00:47.860 --> 00:55.700
And as much as possible it will help ensure that a business logic change needs to affect only one service.

00:55.900 --> 01:03.060
The most widely used method of decomposing a system into micro services is through business capability.

01:03.160 --> 01:10.210
So if for example we have an e-commerce site and two of its core functions are order management and

01:10.210 --> 01:16.790
shopping carts management the different business capabilities are required in each area would be further

01:16.790 --> 01:23.310
broken down to help make sure the micro services are fine grained and promote loose coupling and high

01:23.330 --> 01:24.320
cohesion.

01:24.710 --> 01:32.090
So for example forming part of the order management business capability we could have an order history

01:32.270 --> 01:39.500
micro service and order placement micro service and order chequing micro service and order dispute micro

01:39.500 --> 01:41.090
service.

01:41.090 --> 01:47.480
Similarly the shopping cart management business functionalities for the e-commerce site could be broken

01:47.480 --> 01:54.860
down into the micro services cart selling cars cost co-curator carts promotions and abandoned cartes

01:54.890 --> 01:56.930
recovery.

01:57.120 --> 02:05.040
In some cases especially in systems with many different technical or complex processes that are obstructed

02:05.370 --> 02:08.820
or not but related to the business capabilities.

02:09.270 --> 02:16.200
It may also be required to decompose the system into micro services not only based on the business capabilities

02:16.530 --> 02:23.130
but also on technical capabilities or functional objectives to make sure that each Microcircuits has

02:23.220 --> 02:25.140
a suitable level of granularity.
